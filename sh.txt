Let’s begin with an easy, if somewhat naive version of word tokenization and normalization (and frequency computation) that can be accomplished for English solely
in a single UNIX command-line, inspired by Church (1994). We’ll make use of some
Unix commands: tr, used to systematically change particular characters in the input; sort, which sorts input lines in alphabetical order; and uniq, which collapses
and counts adjacent identical lines.
For example let’s begin with the ‘complete words’ of Shakespeare in one file,
sh.txt. We can use tr to tokenize the words by changing every sequence of nonalphabetic characters to a newline (’A-Za-z’ means alphabetic, the -c option complements to non-alphabet, and the -s option squeezes all sequences into a single
character):
tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' < sh.txt
The output of this command will be:
THE
SONNETS
by
William
Shakespeare
From
fairest
creatures
We
...
Now that there is one word per line, we can sort the lines, and pass them to uniq
-c which will collapse and count them:
tr -sc ’A-Za-z’ ’\n’ < sh.txt | sort | uniq -c
with the following output:
1945 A
72 AARON
19 ABBESS
25 Aaron
6 Abate
1 Abates
5 Abbess
6 Abbey
3 Abbot
...
Alternatively, we can collapse all the upper case to lower case:
tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' < sh.txt | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c
whose output is
14725 a
97 aaron
1 abaissiez
10 abandon
2 abandoned
2 abase
1 abash
14 abate
3 abated
3 abatement
...
Now we can sort again to find the frequent words. The -n option to sort means
to sort numerically rather than alphabetically, and the -r option means to sort in
reverse order (highest-to-lowest):
tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n' < sh.txt | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
The results show that the most frequent words in Shakespeare, as in any other
corpus, are the short function words like articles, pronouns, prepositions:
27378 the
26084 and
22538 i
19771 to
17481 of
14725 a
13826 you
12489 my
11318 that
11112 in
...
Unix tools of this sort can be very handy in building quick word count statistics
for any corpus.
